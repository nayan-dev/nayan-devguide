## Onboard Computer

The Onboard Computer supplied with Nayan is Odroid U3, although it should be able to support other onboard computers as well like Beaglebone or RPi. The connection between Onboard Computer and Slave/Master Controller could be established through either USB or Serial port. Applications can be developed using tools like MAVROS, Dronekit. Please checkout the relevant docs for instructions on how to write your own applications.
